                In 1957, mathematician Steve Smale discovered that a sphere could theoretically be turned inside out by using smooth motions and self-intersections without making tears or sharp creases; then in 1961, Arnold Shapiro found a practical way to do so. Since that time, several other methods for turning a sphere inside out have been discovered, one of which is Bill Thurston's method, invented in 1974.

            <p>
                Thurston's method was featured in a 1994 film ‘Outside In’ by The Geometry Center at the University of Minnesota. The Geometry Center closed in 1998.
                This project ports the sphere eversion program to JavaScript and visualizes it using Three.js
